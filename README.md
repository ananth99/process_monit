# ProcessMonit

A simple Process Monitor in Elixir.

* Implementation to find `pid` for chrome.
* Kill a chrome process

## ToDo
* Extend functionality to other processes(nginx, postgres, apache, etc.)
* Ability to perform `process` health checks repeatedly and restart if `process` goes down
* Get misc info like process uptime, memory usage etc.
